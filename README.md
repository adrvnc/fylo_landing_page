## My process

### Built with
- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

Instead of using bootstrap, I learned how to make an entire landing 
page responsive using CSS media queries. 

### Continued development

This project is the first I've completed without using any framework. I 
used this opportunity to learn the fundamentals and will continue
to do so. 

### Useful resources

- [Column Layout](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_four_columns.asp) - This helped me create a responsive four-column layout grid. The same principle can be applied to different grid layouts. 
- [Responsive Flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox_responsive.asp) - This is perfect for people who want to understand CSS Flexbox.
